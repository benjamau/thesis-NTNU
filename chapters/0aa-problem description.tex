The use of robot vacuum cleaner is rapidly increasing in all kinds of smart environments. Vendors are developing new smart features and APIs to allow maximum functionality and integration flexibility. Vendors develops smart phone applications, to make it easier for users to personalize their robot vacuum cleaner experience. These applications are delivered through cloud services, commando and control is communicated between smart environments and cloud services. This communication is generating network traffic in local wireless, and cabled network as well as Internet traffic. The traffic generated by the robot vacuum cleaner will reflect the actions made by users, and potentially expose user private information. An attacker can eavesdrop the network traffic in different phases in the communication. 

Smart phone application uses encrypted end-to-end communication to mitigate the risk of any expose of private information. This kind of security measures are implemented by the application itself and not the network transferring the information. Information about IP-addresses, packet lengths, ports and sub
