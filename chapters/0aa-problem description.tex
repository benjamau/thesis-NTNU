Today's robot vacuum cleaners includes a lot of smart features which can optimize the cleaning process in their smart home environment. Laser and camera sensors will map the entire home and can provide high detailed information about the environment, as well as scheduled cleaning often is done when the home owners is away.

The objective of this Thesis is to evaluate the network traffic generated by the robot vacuum cleaner and find exposed private information. The traffic analysis will include IEEE 802.11 and 802.3 to determine if they reveal different information or combined exposes more information. The research questions to be answered is: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which private information can be gathered from robot vacuum cleaners by carrying out a passive sniffing attack of network traffic in a smart home?
    \item Is it possible to attribute different events on a robot vacuum cleaner with only access to the network flow and metadata?
    \item How can information exposed in the sniffing attack be misused by an attacker?
    \item Which security measures can be implemented to limit the exposed data and decrease the risk of misuse? 
\end{itemize}
