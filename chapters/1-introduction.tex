\chapter{Introduction}

The use of IoT devices has expanded massively the last decade, the though of being able to check how much milk that is left in the fridge while you are at the store, or being able to unlock the door after seeing the electrician through the front door camera from miles away. These smart home features have developed from futuristic thoughts to a necessity in the every day smart home. One of the most popular IoT smart home devices is the robot vacuum cleaners, they have developed to scheduled cleaning when the home owners are away, they can clean only selected part of the home and even discover if the pet is in a moulting period and suggest to clean some areas more often. With all this data gathering comes new challenges with storing transferring and processing the private information. The data captured by the sensors on the vacuums needs to be transferred from the device to a network based server which can process and display the data for the consumer. 


\section{Problem Domain}
%Clearly introduce the problem domain of your research 
%What problem(s) you attempt to address? What is your motivation?
%How did other researches solve the problem(s) Are there still some gaps

\section{Research Objectives}
%what goals would you like to achieve? Please clearly define your project goals. 
%What are your research questions?
 The research questions to be answered is: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which private information can be gathered from robot vacuum cleaners by carrying out a passive sniffing attack of network traffic in a smart home?
    \item Is it possible to attribute different events on a robot vacuum cleaner with only access to the network flow and metadata?
    \item How can information exposed in the sniffing attack be misused by an attacker?
    \item Which security measures can be implemented to limit the exposed data and decrease the risk of misuse? 
\end{itemize}
