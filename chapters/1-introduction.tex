The use of IoT devices has expanded massively the last decade, the though of being able to check how much milk that is left in the fridge while you are at the store, or being able to unlock the door after seeing the electrician through the front door camera from miles away. These smart home features have developed from futuristic thoughts to a necessity in the every day smart home. One of the most popular IoT smart home devices is the robot vacuum cleaners, they have developed to scheduled cleaning when the home owners are away, they can clean only selected part of the home and even discover if the pet is in a moulting period and suggest to clean some areas more often. With all this data gathering comes new challenges with storing transferring and processing the private information. The data captured by the sensors on the vacuums needs to be transferred from the device to a network based server which can process and display the data for the consumer.
